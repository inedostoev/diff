# Differentiator

This is a differentiator, a program that differentiates the input function, and does it almost like Wolfram Alpha.

This version of the program supports the differentiation of functions that contain `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` and `ln`

# Build
You should install `graphviz`, `xdot` and `pdflatex` to visualize differentiation and optimizations.

Than build project with `make` command.

# Hou to use?
Write your function in `input/configFile.txt`. Than execute `./diff`. Look at result in `output/diff.pdf`
